# REPORTING AUTOMATION - EXCEL -- XML -- AI -- PYTHON -- EXCEL OR POWER BI


Project Plan 1: Building the Foundation for AI-Based Excel Reporting Automation


Phase 1: Initial Setup and XML Parsing (1-2 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Extract the XML files from Excel workbooks and prepare for relationship mapping.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Understand Excel’s Structure: Study how Excel files are stored as zipped XML archives, focusing on key XML files (xl/worksheets/sheetX.xml, xl/sharedStrings.xml, xl/styles.xml, etc.).
	•	Extract XML Data: Use Python’s zipfile and xml.etree.ElementTree modules to extract and parse the XML files.
	•	Build XML Parsing Functions: Create functions to extract data, styles, and formulas from the parsed XML files.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Write Python scripts using libraries like zipfile for file extraction.
	•	Implement XML parsers to identify sheet names, data in cells, and formulas.
	•	Store the parsed data in structured formats (e.g., dictionaries, data frames).







Phase 1: Initial Setup and XML Parsing
    1.	extract_excel_xml(file_path): This function extracts XML files from an Excel workbook (.xlsx).
	2.	parse_worksheets(xml_files): This function parses worksheet XML files to extract cell data and formulas, organizing them into dictionaries.
	3.	parse_shared_strings(xml_files): This function extracts text values from the shared strings XML, used for cell contents.
	4.	parse_styles(xml_files): A placeholder function for parsing styles (if needed).
	5.	main(file_path): Orchestrates the parsing process and returns the extracted data as dictionaries.





Here’s a list of the key XML components within an .xlsx file that are commonly parsed, along with descriptions of what they contain:

1. xl/worksheets/sheetX.xml

	•	Description: Represents each worksheet in the Excel file (X is the sheet index). Contains all cell data for the sheet, including values, formulas, cell references, and types.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<c>: Represents a cell. Attributes include r (cell reference), t (cell type).
	•	<v>: Contains the cell’s value.
	•	<f>: Contains the formula (if present).

2. xl/sharedStrings.xml

	•	Description: Stores all unique text strings used in the workbook to optimize space and avoid duplication in cell definitions.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<si>: Shared string item containing text nodes.
	•	<t>: The text of the shared string.

3. xl/styles.xml

	•	Description: Contains styles applied to cells, including fonts, colors, number formats, and borders. Essential for interpreting how data is formatted (e.g., date, currency).
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<numFmts>: Custom number formats.
	•	<fonts>: Definitions of fonts used.
	•	<fills>: Background fill styles.
	•	<borders>: Border styles.
	•	<cellXfs>: Cell formatting records, referencing other style components.

4. xl/workbook.xml

	•	Description: Defines the workbook’s structure, including sheet names, order, and visibility.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<sheets>: Contains a list of all sheets.
	•	<sheet>: Each sheet is listed with its name, ID, and order in the workbook.

5. xl/calcChain.xml

	•	Description: Lists the calculation sequence for cells containing formulas. Useful for understanding the order of dependency calculations in complex workbooks.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<c>: Represents a cell involved in the calculation chain. Attributes include r (cell reference) and i (sheet ID).

6. xl/drawings/drawingX.xml

	•	Description: Represents drawings, shapes, charts, and images embedded within the worksheets.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<xdr:twoCellAnchor>: Represents objects anchored between two cells.
	•	<a:blip>: Contains image references.

7. xl/tables/tableX.xml

	•	Description: Contains data table definitions within worksheets, including table ranges, column headers, and style information.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<table>: Defines the table, including range and name.
	•	<tableColumns>: List of columns in the table.

8. xl/worksheets/_rels/sheetX.xml.rels

	•	Description: Contains relationship information for objects in a specific worksheet (e.g., linked images, charts).
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<Relationship>: Defines relationships to other parts of the workbook (e.g., charts, external links).

9. xl/theme/themeX.xml

	•	Description: Defines the workbook’s theme, including colors, fonts, and effects, used to style the workbook and its elements.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<a:clrScheme>: Color scheme.
	•	<a:fontScheme>: Font scheme.

10. [Content_Types].xml

	•	Description: Lists all content types in the workbook, including parts like worksheets, charts, styles, and images.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<Override>: Lists each part of the document, indicating its content type (e.g., worksheet, table, chart).

11. xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels

	•	Description: Defines relationships between the workbook and other components, such as worksheets, shared strings, and styles.
	•	Key Elements:
	•	<Relationship>: Each relationship points to a specific component (e.g., a worksheet, shared strings, styles).

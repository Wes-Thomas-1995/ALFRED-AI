# REPORTING AUTOMATION - EXCEL -- XML -- AI -- PYTHON -- EXCEL OR POWER BI


Project Plan 1: Building the Foundation for AI-Based Excel Reporting Automation

This project plan covers steps up to the point of building the AI, focusing on parsing the Excel file and mapping relationships to form the basis for automation.

Phase 1: Initial Setup and XML Parsing (1-2 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Extract the XML files from Excel workbooks and prepare for relationship mapping.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Understand Excel’s Structure: Study how Excel files are stored as zipped XML archives, focusing on key XML files (xl/worksheets/sheetX.xml, xl/sharedStrings.xml, xl/styles.xml, etc.).
	•	Extract XML Data: Use Python’s zipfile and xml.etree.ElementTree modules to extract and parse the XML files.
	•	Build XML Parsing Functions: Create functions to extract data, styles, and formulas from the parsed XML files.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Write Python scripts using libraries like zipfile for file extraction.
	•	Implement XML parsers to identify sheet names, data in cells, and formulas.
	•	Store the parsed data in structured formats (e.g., dictionaries, data frames).

Phase 2: Parsing and Identifying Excel Formulas (2-3 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Extract and identify formulas within the Excel sheets.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Formula Extraction: Parse cells in the XML files to identify those containing formulas (tagged with <f> in the XML).
	•	List Formulas: Create a list of formulas and their references (e.g., A1, B2, etc.) for each sheet.
	•	Cross-Sheet References: Identify formulas that reference cells in other sheets (e.g., Sheet2!A1).
	3.	Execution:
	•	Develop functions to scan through XML nodes for formula tags.
	•	Create a mapping of formulas to their input and output cells for easy referencing.
	•	Store this information in a structure (e.g., JSON) for easy access during relationship mapping.

Phase 3: Mapping Relationships Between Cells (2-4 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Create a representation of how data flows within and across sheets in the workbook.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Dependency Graph Creation: Construct a directed graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent dependencies (e.g., if A1 depends on B2, create an edge from B2 to A1).
	•	Read Calculation Chain: Use the calcChain.xml file to understand the order in which cells are calculated.
	•	Identify Clusters: Group cells with similar formulas (e.g., tables) to recognize repeating patterns.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Implement a graph data structure to model cell relationships.
	•	Use Python libraries like networkx to visualize and handle the graph.
	•	Write algorithms to traverse the graph and identify dependencies, cross-sheet references, and data clusters.

Phase 4: Building the Data Flow Model (2-3 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Create a model that the AI can use to understand how information is processed in the Excel workbook.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	JSON-Based Structure: Organize all parsed data (formulas, dependencies, clusters) into a structured format (JSON). This provides a clear, standardized input for the AI.
	•	Testing Data Consistency: Verify that all relationships and formulas are correctly captured in the data model by cross-checking with original Excel data.
	•	Define Action Mappings: Begin defining how specific formulas (e.g., VLOOKUP, IF) map to Python functions for later use by the AI.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Consolidate all extracted data into a comprehensive JSON file representing the Excel workbook.
	•	Test with different Excel files to ensure the parsing and relationship mapping is robust.
	•	Develop a preliminary action mapping to understand which functions need to be automated by the AI.

Phase 5: Initial AI Framework Development (3-4 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Set up a basic AI framework that can interpret the structured data and plan the sequence of actions.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Framework Setup: Set up a machine learning environment using Python (e.g., Scikit-learn) and install necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, if required).
	•	Preliminary Training Data: Create initial training data using a variety of Excel files with known mappings to define how the AI should interpret formulas and actions.
	•	Basic Model Design: Design a basic model to recognize patterns in formulas and map them to Python functions.
	3.	Execution:
	•	Use structured data from Phase 4 to build an initial dataset for training.
	•	Develop a basic AI model that can take formula mappings and identify appropriate functions to call.
	•	Test the model with simple formulas to evaluate its understanding and identify areas for improvement.

Total Estimated Timeline: 12-16 Weeks










Phase 1: Initial Setup and XML Parsing
    1.	extract_excel_xml(file_path): This function extracts XML files from an Excel workbook (.xlsx).
	2.	parse_worksheets(xml_files): This function parses worksheet XML files to extract cell data and formulas, organizing them into dictionaries.
	3.	parse_shared_strings(xml_files): This function extracts text values from the shared strings XML, used for cell contents.
	4.	parse_styles(xml_files): A placeholder function for parsing styles (if needed).
	5.	main(file_path): Orchestrates the parsing process and returns the extracted data as dictionaries.


Phase 2: Parsing and Identifying Excel Formulas
	1.	extract_formulas(worksheets): Extracts formulas from the parsed worksheet data, storing them in a dictionary for each sheet.
	2.	identify_cross_sheet_references(formulas): Identifies formulas that reference cells from other sheets, useful for mapping inter-sheet dependencies.
	3.	list_formulas_and_references(worksheets): Lists formulas along with their input references and output cells. Uses a regex-based helper function to find cell references within formulas.
	4.	extract_references_from_formula(formula): A helper function using regex to extract cell references (e.g., A1, Sheet2!A1) from a formula.
	5.	phase_2_example(worksheets): Combines the above functions to extract and return formulas, cross-sheet references, and formula references.


Phase 3: Mapping Relationships Between Cells
    1.	create_dependency_graph(formula_refs): Creates a directed graph representing cell dependencies using networkx. Nodes are cells, and edges indicate dependencies between them (e.g., a formula in A1 depending on B1 and C1).
	2.	identify_formula_clusters(formula_refs): Identifies clusters of cells with similar formulas in each sheet. Groups cells based on their formula, providing insight into repetitive patterns, such as columns with the same computation.
	3.	map_cross_sheet_references(cross_sheet_refs, worksheets): Maps cross-sheet references to identify how data flows between sheets, such as when a formula in one sheet references a cell from another sheet.
	4.	phase_3_example(formula_refs, cross_sheet_refs, worksheets): Combines the functions to create a dependency graph, identify clusters, and map cross-sheet references.

Results (Example):
	•	Formula Clusters: Identifies groups of cells with the same formulas. Example output: {'Sheet1': [['A1'], ['C1']], 'Sheet2': [['A1']]}.
	•	Cross-Sheet Map: Tracks where cells in one sheet reference cells in another. Example output: {'Sheet1': {'Sheet2': [('C1', 'A1')]}}.

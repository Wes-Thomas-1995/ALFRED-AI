Project Plan 2: Building the AI and Automating Excel Reporting

This project plan covers the steps from building the AI onwards, leveraging the foundational components set up in Project Plan 1. The focus is on developing, training, and integrating the AI with the parsed Excel data to automate reporting processes.

Phase 1: AI Model Design and Data Preparation (3-4 Weeks)

	1.	Objective: Design an AI model capable of interpreting parsed Excel data, understanding formulas, dependencies, and relationships, and translating these into automated actions.
	2.	Key Tasks:
	•	Define Model Requirements: Identify the types of actions the AI needs to perform (e.g., parsing formulas, generating Python functions, creating summary reports). This step includes deciding on the specific model architecture (e.g., neural network, decision tree).

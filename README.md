# ALFRED_AI
This is an AI application which is targetting the automation of existing reporting processes predominantly within excel.
The project is multi-faceted whereby it will have the following key functions:

1 - Reporting Automation
- It will take existing reporting processes consisting of reporting manuals or guides, itemise the steps whilst taking the excel file and completely automating the process. It will break down the file to convert the process into a scheduled task executable with python script.

2 - Ad-Hoc Automation
- It will have an agent who will be able to handle multi-dimensional reporting needs to fetch data baased on user prompt. This is perfect for client orientates tasks.

3 - New Reporting Demand
- It will be able to take user input to create an entirely new report bassed on the user input. Criteria passed into the AI will be converted into script which can merge tables and perform functions to create the views a given user wants. 

4 - ALFRED OS
- The system will be build on a Django - React framework which will give a high level of sophistication in the way a user interacts with it. The background DB will be Postgres with a caching system.
